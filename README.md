# Parking-Lot-Occupancy-Detector
Wireless Sensor Project - Parking Lot Occupancy Detector

Project Description

  The main objective of this project is to develop a sensor network that detects the number of available parking spaces in a parking lot by sensing the number of cars entering and exiting the parking lot using a pair of motes equipped with magnetometer sensors placed at the entrance and exit locations. The number of cars detected by the sensor at the entrance and exit motes are used by a base station to continuously update the free spaces in the parking lot. The number of available slots calculated by the base station is transferred to Internet in real time and updated in a Dropbox file. The platform used is Micaz motes as sensor nodes and MTS 310 as sensor boards. Programs are written in nesC code in TinyOS software.
